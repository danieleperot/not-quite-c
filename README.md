# Not quite C

An attempt to create my own programming language, just to understand the challenges involved.

The created language is inspired by C, but it's most definitely not the same thing.

Credits to https://github.com/tsoding for the inspiration, I basically copy-pasted half of his
B-related videos into
this project.
